This model recognizes the head pose of a person in terms of 3 angles: *yaw*, *pitch* and *roll* in an image. The face detection model is used to locate the face region prior to inferring the head pose angles.

Please refer to the document *experiment_2021* included in this repo and follow the instructions to complete this experiment.
